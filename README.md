**The anima and animus** are described in _Carl Jung's_ school of analytical psychology as part of his theory of the collective unconscious.
Jung described **the animus** as the unconscious _masculine side_ of _a woman_, and **the anima** as the unconscious _feminine side_ of _a man_, each transcending the personal psyche.
Jung's theory states that **the anima and animus** are the two primary anthropomorphic archetypes of the unconscious mind, as opposed to the theriomorphic and inferior function of the shadow archetypes.
He believed they are the abstract symbol sets that formulate the archetype of the Self.

In Jung's theory, **the anima** makes up the totality of the unconscious _feminine psychological_ qualities that *a man* possesses and **the animus** the _masculine_ ones possessed by *a woman*. He did not believe they were an aggregate of father or mother, brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, or teachers, though these aspects of the personal unconscious can influence _a person's_ **anima or animus**.
